Extend the debugging of the emulators.
For CP/M debugging ddt.com was the original hex debuger.
Although you could step instructions it had no symbols.

Sid.com added symbolic debugging.  zsid.com was for z80
debug.  Both sid and zsid used the .sym files from a linker
to provide names for addresses.

But here were two problems. 1- both debuggers shared address
space with the target being debugged. So you could not debug
a big program. and 2-there was no per source line debug info.
A byte in the program had no mapping back to its source line.
Also there was no multi level mapping.  We wrote ~/cl/mbasic
it can compile a .bas basic program to c. that is then
comppiled via z88dk to make .com file.  So even if the c line
number info was preserved the basic info and file names are not.

Look into, as in research and propose plans to add full symbolic
debug info to this emulator.
- for the alair based emulator, the sym info can be loaded with the program
into the emulator address space. that way large progams can be debugged.
- for cpmemu emulator make shim porgram luke usid.com or uzsid.com that
gets the executable name and traps out to the emulator to get the sym info

The sources and manuals for sid and zsid are on the web for ideas of
functionality needed (other than the full symbols).

We could emulate zsid/sid.  Or I have heard gdb supporting all manner of debugging
for multi layer (basic->c->asm) and all sorts of processors. Some sort of gdb
integration might be good.
